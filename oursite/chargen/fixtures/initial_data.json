/*
One way to provide the app with initial data is to type it here as json.

I (David) expect this to be easier than the admin site for small amounts of data (i.e, the
one or two char_classes and one or two races needed to test), but less efficient than using 
the admin site in the long run.

More information can be found at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/howto/initial-data/
