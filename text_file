Rachel or Rachael, if you're reading this, your git works!
This is RACHAEL, spelled the RIGHT way

Gaily bedight,
A gallant knight,
In sunshine and in shadow,
Had journeyed long
Singing a song
In search of Eldorado.

But he grew old,
This knight so bold,
And o’er his heart a shadow
Fell as he found
No sight of ground
That looked like Eldorado.

And, as his strength
Failed him at length,
He met a pilgrim shadow.
“Shadow,” said he,
“Where can it be,
This land of Eldorado?”

“Over the mountains
Of the moon
Down the valley of the shadow,
Ride, boldly ride,”
the shade replied,
“If you seek for Eldorado.”
